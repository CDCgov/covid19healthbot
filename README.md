# CDC COVID-19 Health Bot

### CDC is retiring the Coronavirus Self-Checker webpage on October 7, 2022. Refer to the [COVID-19 symptoms page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html) for information on when to seek COVID-19 testing and medical care.

## Overview

This project collects automated screening protocols and self-checker algorithms from organizations implementing [CDC screening protocols](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) in interactive web sites, chat bots, and other technology.

Use of these algorithms and associated files does not imply a CDC endorsement of any one particular product, service or enterprise. U.S. Government logos, including the CDC logo, cannot be used without express, written permission. These algorithms were designed based on the best available science and should not be modified or altered. Use of these algorithms must be accompanied by the following disclaimer and non-endorsement language:

```This COVID-19 self-checker algorithm was originally developed by CDC for use as an interactive “bot” experience. CDC does not guarantee the accuracy of any non-U.S. Government version(s) of a COVID-19 self-checker algorithm. The U.S. Government does not make any warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, for any non-U.S. Government version of the COVID-19 self-checker algorithm . Use by a non-U.S. Government organization or enterprise does not imply a U.S. Government endorsement of any one particular product, service, or enterprise or that this use of the COVID-19 self-checker algorithm represents the official views of the U.S. Government.```

## List of Screening Protocols

This list is subject to change. Pull requests are welcome from organizations with additional tools implementing CDC protocols that may be useful to capture here:

* COVID-19 Protocol - protocol used with [CDC Coronavirus Self-Checker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html). There are 3 scenarios - 1 wrapper and 2 core protocols, and 1 string table. The latest scenarios should only be used in English. The Non-English language scenarios contain the most update to date translations available, which might not be the most update to date algorithm version. As we receive translations for the latest algorithm version, the Non-English scenarios will be updated. (Please note:  Version 74 consolidated guidance from 6 scenarios back down to 3.)
  * Latest Scenarios in English
    * [COVID-19 Core Adult Protocol](./screening_protocols/latest/covid_19_core_vaccinated_protocol.json) - definition file for the adult core COVID-19 protocol latest version in English
    * [COVID-19 Core Pediatric Protocol](./screening_protocols/latest/covid_19_core_pediatric_vaccinated_protocol.json) - definition file for the pediatric core COVID-19 protocol latest version in English
    * [COVID-19 CDC Wrapper](./screening_protocols/latest/covid_19_cdc_wrapper.json) - definition file for the CDC specific questions, including disclaimer and US location for the latest version in English
    * [COVID-19 Content and Messages](./screening_protocols/latest/covid_19_protocol_content_and_messages.pdf) - provides all content in the latest online tool for English. Includes all questions, logic, and provided messages. 
    * [COVID-19 Algorithm](./screening_protocols/latest/covid_19_protocol_algorithm.pdf) - provides a flowchart / logic diagram of the tool for the latest English scenarios.
  * Non-English Scenarios
    * [COVID-19 Core Adult Protocol Non-English](./screening_protocols/non-english/covid_19_core_vaccinated_protocol_non-english.json) - definition file for the adult core COVID-19 protocol latest version in other languages
    * [COVID-19 Core Pediatric Protocol Non-English](./screening_protocols/non-english/covid_19_core_pediatric_vaccinated_protocol_non-english.json) - definition file for the pediatric core COVID-19 protocol latest version in other languages
    * [COVID-19 CDC Wrapper Non-English](./screening_protocols/non-english/covid_19_cdc_wrapper_non-english.json) - definition file for the CDC specific questions, including disclaimer and US location for the latest version in other languages
    * [COVID-19 Content and Messages](./screening_protocols/non-english/covid_19_protocol_content_and_messages_non-english.pdf) - provides all content in the latest online tool for other languages. Includes all questions, logic, and provided messages. 
    * [COVID-19 Algorithm](./screening_protocols/non-english/covid_19_protocol_algorithm_non-english.pdf) - provides a flowchart / logic diagram of the tool for the other languages scenarios.
  * [Localization Strings](./screening_protocols/localization-custom-strings.xlsx) - this contains the localization string table that should be imported into your health bot instance. It contains strings for both English and Non-English scenarios. This file **must** be imported for the health bot to function properly. Please use [this reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/healthbot/localization) for more information on importing the file. 
  * [Customizing the Self-Checker](https://github.com/CDCgov/covid19healthbot/wiki) - shows how to customize the outcome message in the core protocols, as well as leverage the core protocol conversation data in a wrapping scenario
* [COVID-19 Screening Protocol](./screening_protocols/covid_19_screening_protocol_cdc_apple.pdf) - visual description of the protocol used for [coronavirus.gov screening tool](https://www.coronavirus.gov/).
